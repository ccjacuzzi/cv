  <p><em>Computer Science Student at the <strong><a href="https://ualr.edu/www/">University of Arkansas at Little Rock</a></strong></em></p>
  <p>
    I graduated with a bachelors degree in liberal arts(now called interdiciplinary studies) from UA Little Rock in 2007. Immediately following the completion of that program, I jumped right into their MBA program.
    I felt like my Liberal Arts degree did not prepare me for any careers that I would enjoy. Rather than take a step back and really figure out what I wanted to do with my life,
    I jumped into a masters program. During my second semester of business classes, I realized that this was not taking me where I wanted to go. I switched to the systems engineering
    bachelors program. I was very interested in the engineering and just about anything technical. Unfortunately, I was lacking in math skills. I really struggled to make my way through
    trigonometry and calculus I. I aslo struggled with calculus based physics I & II. During these struggles, my son was born. I decided to put school on hold and just get a job. This was 2010.
    In 2020, my mother was one of the first Arkansans to be taken by Covid. While she was struggling for her life in the hospital, I was layed off from my job as a medical sales rep. You would
    assume that a pandemic would be a good thing for a company that sells medical equipment, but that wasn't the case. It was a tough time. I decided that it was time to reevaluate my life and get
    back on track. During the years of boring work since leaving the engineering program, I became interested in computer science. Also, the field holds much more opportunity than mechanical engineering.
